### Description of my program
This depends entirely on the type of project 3. The three project constraints need to be discussed in detail with the client before the project starts. The users need to know what it will cost in terms of Equilateral and Isosceles, as well as Scalene. You’ll also want to establish that there won’t be any sudden or drastic changes during the project.

#### objectives
 * Triangle Tracker
 * Equilateral Triangles
 * Isosceles Triangles
 * Scalene Triangles
